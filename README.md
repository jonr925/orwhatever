orwhatever
==========

The OR-Whatever iPhone app developed at iOSDevCamp2013. I did this with my 14 year old daughter and my 16 year old son. We came up with the idea on Friday afternoon, and it was complete by noon on Sunday. I (Jon Richards) did all the coding, and I taught my kids how to use Gimp for the artwork.

This app won the "Best Social Media App" at iOSDevCamp2013. Did it in 20 hours!

NOTE: This app does not work well in the simulator. It has to be running on an iPhone in order for it to access the native facebook.
